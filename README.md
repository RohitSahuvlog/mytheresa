We all individually did the task but not completed it on that date which I decided earlier or partially completed. It happens because we neglect the less important parts such as some CSS to the page. But the website is not completed until you match all the items so we have to consider all parts and give them equal importance to each one.
Second thing is that we neglect media queries at first and think that we will complete them later. But in last we struggled so much to change the website. We also have to consider CSS grid properties even when there is no chance to apply them. We have to find a way to apply it. Otherwise, we will face huge problems.
