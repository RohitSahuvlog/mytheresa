Clone of mytheresa
Hello, friends my name is Rohit and I created my Constructed week project my theresa. this is Ecommerce
These five days of my project taught me so many things. I learned both soft and coding skills. I managed my own individual skills to achieve the desired result at starting.
I learned one more interesting skill. We always want a solution to the problem. But in these five days, I learned how to make the solution I tried by some hints of IAs, took some google suggestions, and struggled a lot to achieve the desired result. I write some codes which are not taught yet but someone did some similar things and I learned them and achieved my goal.


Project statement and expectations
We made a clone of the mytheresa website by which we can check each and every news related to clothes.
How all these things Completed.
When me and my team member Rohit were creating the Navbar, a lot of mistakes & challenges Infront of our eyes.
________________


For Example:-when We were merging the Navbar pages with others pages. styles are overwritten. At that time it teaches us how to deal with this problem. during the making of our websites.
  



and exploring the new things and that’s how the project was completed
Concepts we covered
1. HTML
I have learned some properties of HTML tags like span. I generally didn’t prefer span but it is a good inline-level element. By using it there is no need to use CSS property (display: flex)
1. CSS
I have learned some good Properties such as cursor: pointer, text-decoration: underline, etc.
1. JAVASCRIPT
I have learned some good functions such as count, window resize, onkeyup, etc
Key learning points and improvements that can be made:
We all individually did the task but not completed it on that date which I decided earlier or partially completed. It happens because we neglect the less important parts such as some CSS to the page. But the website is not completed until you match all the items so we have to consider all parts and give them equal importance to each one.
Second thing is that we neglect media queries at first and think that we will complete them later. But in last we struggled so much to change the website. We also have to consider CSS grid properties even when there is no chance to apply them. We have to find a way to apply it. Otherwise, we will face huge problems.
